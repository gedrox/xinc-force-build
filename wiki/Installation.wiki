{{{
<project name="...">
    ...
    <cron timer="*/5 * * * *"/>
    <modificationset>
        <svn directory="${dir}" />

  # Check the HTTP server user has permission to create a file in the project data folder "/var/xinc/status/{project_name}/". For some reason folders "/var/xinc/" and "/var/xinc/status/" didn't have listing permission for the owner out of the box. Had to run these commands:
{{{
$ chmod +x /var/xinc/
$ chmod +x /var/xinc/status/
}}}
